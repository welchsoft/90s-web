      <p class='negatives'>Whether its padding single player, or adding pay to win in multiplayer, loot boxes are the "solution" to a manufactured problem, its a shake down plain and simple. Ignoring the boxes isnt a real answer either, play any game with this false savior and you will still have to deal with all the game altering side effects that are intended to make buying boxes seem like a better alternative in the first place. Even if you don't pay the troll his toll you still have to put up with the stench</p>
